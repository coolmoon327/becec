# Wolpertinger Architecture

This module is used for DDPG-like architectures, refering to [Deep Reinforcement Learning in Large Discrete Action Spaces](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.07679.pdf).

You should change the critic training codes, in order to let the target critic network use actions from wolp outputs.
